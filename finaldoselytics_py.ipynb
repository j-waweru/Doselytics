        "    Here is a guide you can use:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Supplement manufacturers often use various tricks and marketing tactics to make their products seem more effective or appealing. Here are some common strategies:\n",
        "\n",
        " 1. Proprietary Blends\n",
        "   - Explanation: Companies list a mix of ingredients as a “proprietary blend” without disclosing the exact amounts of each ingredient.\n",
        "   - Reason: This allows manufacturers to use minimal effective dosages of costly or effective ingredients while bulking up the blend with cheaper fillers.\n",
        "   - Impact: Consumers don’t know if they’re getting an effective dose of the key ingredients.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. Fairy Dusting\n",
        "   - Explanation: Including a small, ineffective amount of a popular or proven ingredient just to list it on the label.\n",
        "   - Reason: This can make the supplement look more powerful without the cost of including effective doses.\n",
        "   - Impact: Misleads consumers into thinking the product is more effective than it is.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3. Under-Dosing\n",
        "   - Explanation: Using less than the scientifically recommended dosage of an active ingredient.\n",
        "   - Reason: To reduce costs while being able to claim the ingredient is present.\n",
        "   - Impact: Consumers may not get the desired effect due to insufficient amounts.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4. Over-Dosing of Cheaper Ingredients\n",
        "   - Explanation: Using high amounts of inexpensive or less effective ingredients to create the appearance of a strong formula.\n",
        "   - Reason: To bulk up the label and make the supplement seem packed with active substances.\n",
        "   - Impact: May lead to the inclusion of unnecessary or even harmful amounts of certain components.\n",
        "\n",
        " 5. Claims Without Evidence\n",
        "   - Explanation: Making strong health or performance claims that aren't backed by reliable studies or evidence.\n",
        "   - Reason: Marketing ploys designed to attract attention and boost sales.\n",
        "   - Impact: Consumers may be misled into believing a product is more effective than it really is.\n",
        "\n",
        " 6. Ingredient Sourcing and Quality\n",
        "   - Explanation: Using lower-quality or less bioavailable forms of ingredients.\n",
        "   - Reason: Cost-saving measures that still allow the manufacturer to list the ingredient on the label.\n",
        "   - Impact: Poor-quality ingredients may not be absorbed well or utilized effectively by the body.\n",
        "\n",
        " 7. Mislabeling and Hidden Ingredients\n",
        "   - Explanation: Failing to properly label ingredients or including substances that aren't disclosed.\n",
        "   - Reason: Can sometimes be done unintentionally, but in some cases, it's a deliberate attempt to hide banned or less desirable substances.\n",
        "   - Impact: Safety and effectiveness can be compromised.\n",
        "\n",
        " 8. ‘Clinically Proven’ Phrases\n",
        "   - Explanation: Using phrases like \"clinically proven\" even when studies may be biased, poorly designed, or funded by the supplement company itself.\n",
        "   - Reason: To gain consumer trust and justify higher prices.\n",
        "   - Impact: Can create a false sense of reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        " 9. Borrowed Science\n",
        "   - Explanation: Claiming benefits based on studies of different forms or dosages of an ingredient, not the specific one used in the supplement.\n",
        "   - Reason: To make a product appear more scientifically supported than it is.\n",
        "   - Impact: Consumers may be misled into believing the product’s efficacy is proven.\n",
        "\n",
        " 10. Unclear Serving Sizes\n",
        "   - Explanation: Using serving sizes that are larger than practical (e.g., recommending multiple pills for one serving).\n",
        "   - Reason: To make it seem like the product has a higher concentration of active ingredients.\n",
        "   - Impact: Can be deceptive about how much of the product you actually need to take to see results.\n",
        "\n",
        " 11. Buzzwords and Over-Promising\n",
        "   - Explanation: Using terms like “all-natural,” “scientifically formulated,” or “pharmaceutical-grade” without regulation or clear meaning.\n",
        "   - Reason: Marketing hype that appeals to health-conscious consumers.\n",
        "   - Impact: Consumers may believe the product is higher quality or more effective than it really is.\n",
        "\n",
        " 12. Artificial Colors and Fillers\n",
        "   - Explanation: Using unnecessary additives to make supplements visually appealing.\n",
        "   - Reason: To differentiate products and improve marketability.\n",
        "   - Impact: These additives may not provide any health benefit and could even be harmful.\n",
        "\n",
        " 13. Label Padding\n",
        "   - Explanation: Adding common vitamins and minerals to boost the ingredient count on the label.\n",
        "   - Reason: To make the product look more comprehensive.\n",
        "   - Impact: Can mislead consumers into thinking they are getting more active ingredients.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Understanding these tricks can help consumers make more informed decisions and choose supplements that are effective and safe.\n",
